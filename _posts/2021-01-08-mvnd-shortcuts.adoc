= `mvnd` tip: shortcuts
:showtitle:
:page-root: ../../../

I am starting to write these tips as a base for the future `https://github.com/mvndaemon/mvnd[mvnd]`
documentation. Today about keystrokes supported in the `mvnd` client UI.

== `+`/`-` to reveal/hide rolling log lines for the individual builder threads

If you are building a multimodule source tree, whose internal dependencies allow for building some modules in parallel,
`mvnd` will by default choose the threaded view (as opposed to the rolling view known from the stock Maven). This
view will normally show a single status line for each builder thread containing the `artifactId` of the module being
build along with the currently executed Maven mojo.

If you want to see the rolling log messages for each thread, hit `+` one or more times. Press `-` to hide them again.
I am hitting 3 times `+` and three times `-` in this video:

[TIP]
====
You can pass your preferred rolling window size using `-Dmvnd.rollingWindowSize=3` on the command line or you
can store it permanently in `~/.m2/mvnd.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
mvnd.rollingWindowSize = 3

== `CTRL+B` to toggle between threaded and rolling views

If you do not like the default threaded view for some reason, you can switch to the rolling view and back by hitting
`CTRL+B`:

[TIP]
====
You can pass `-Dmvnd.noBuffering` on the command line to start with the rolling view or you can store your
preference permanently in `~/.m2/mvnd.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
mvnd.noBuffering = true
----
