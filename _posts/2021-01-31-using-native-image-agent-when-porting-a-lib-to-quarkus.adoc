I pondered a bit how https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/BuildConfiguration/#assisted-configuration-of-native-image-builds[GraalVM's `native-image-agent`] can be leveraged when writing Quarkus extensions.
Even if the configuration produced by it wonâ€™t be 100% complete and relevant, it may give you a good initial impression
where to look and which kinds of problems you need to solve.

== Background

Native compilation of Java using GraalVM's `native-image` tool typically requires a lot of
https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/BuildConfiguration/[configuration].
You need to list classes/methods/fields that require reflection, you need to register proxies,
you need to declare which classes have to be initialized at runtime instead of build time, etc.

If you are on https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus], you usually do not need to care for these nitty-gritty details
because Quarkus does it for you under the hood and `mvn package -Dnative` is all you need to know.

But say, that you are not so lucky to have a ready to use Quarkus extension for some library and you want to write one.
Folks who are not able or not wanting to use Quarkus are actually in quite a similar situation.

== Configuring `native-image`

So how can the `native-image` configuration be put together? Generally speaking there are three options:

=== A. Pure knowledge

You are a GraalVM guru and you know your complete class path so well
that you can write your `native-image` configuration from top of your head.

Well, this is probably not your case, because you are reading this blog post ðŸ˜œ

=== B. Trial and error

You first try to compile your application with no configuration at all.
If the compilation fails, you try to understand the error message and fix what's necessary.
If the message does not make any sense to you, you paste it to google and you hope to find a solution.

Once the compilation succeeds, you start testing the native executable.
It may fail with some `ClassNotFoundException` if you forgot to register some class for reflection
or with a `NullPointerException` if you forgot to embed some resources to the native image.
It may also fail with some cryptic exception that you have no clue about.
You google again and you either find a solution that works for you
or you see only reports of frustration similar to your own.

=== C. `native-image-agent`

The official https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/BuildConfiguration/#assisted-configuration-of-native-image-builds[recommendation of GraalVM] is to use their `native-image-agent`.
You are supposed to put your application (with the agent attached) under a load
that hits all execution paths that will be active also in production.
Based on the runtime data, the agent outputs a configuration in a format acceptable for `native-image`.

This sounds very promising, but of course the main caveat is that
if you are unable to simulate the production load properly during the test runs,
then the produced configuration will not be complete.
Your native application may thus fail in production.

Besides that, the agent records only the usage of some features (namely JNI, Reflection, Proxies and class path resources)
while it does not help with configuring others, like delayed class initialization.
So you still may have to assemble some parts of the configuration manually.

== `native-image` vs. Quarkus

`native-image-agent` was designed for use on plain GraalVM, without Quarkus.
How can we benefit from it when writing Quarkus extensions?

The main idea here is to attach it to the JVM running the application against which we run integration tests.

=== Write tests first

When porting a library or framework to Quarkus, I always start with writing some tests.
Ideally, they should be integration tests.
It means that there should be a real Quarkus application in `src/main/java`
and the tests should communicate with it only via network protocols, like HTTP.
The tests should cover all important use cases of the ported library.

[TIP]
====
Check https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-testing[Quarkus testing guide]
to learn how to write integration tests for Quarkus applications.
====


If I am extremely lucky, the tests just pass in native mode
and the library can be considered working in native without any native image configuration.

But that's very rare. The tests usually pass in JVM mode and they fail in native mode
because some piece of `native-image` configuration is missing.

=== Run tests with `native-image-agent` attached

If you do not know the internals of the ported library well, `native-image-agent` may come in very handy.
Even if the configuration produced by it won't be 100% complete and relevat,
it may give you a good initial impression where to look and which kinds of problems you need to solve.

How can you attach `native-image-agent` to your tests?
Let me explain first how
https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-testing#recap-of-http-based-testing-in-jvm-mode[Quarkus JVM tests]
annotated with `@QuarkusTest` work.

When running the tests from Maven via `mvn test` there are two JVMs taking part in the game:

1. The main Maven JVM
2. A separate JVM started by surefire to run the tests

Should `native-image-agent` be attached to the second one?

While it is certainly the better of the two options, it is still not perfect.
The problem is that this JVM is used not only to run the application under test (living under `src/main`),
but also the test code living under `src/test`.
Clearly, we do not intend to compile the tests to native. We only want to compile the application.

So, how can we split the second JVM into a test JVM and an application JVM?

I have found the following hammer-and-nails procedure (please https://twitter.com/ppalaga[let me know] if you know a better one):

1. Remove the `@QuarkusTest` annotation from all your test classes.
Why? Because otherwise Quarkus JUnit extension would start the application in the test JVM
and that's exactly what we'd like to avoid.

2. Package your application skipping the tests
+
[source,shell]
----
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests
----
+
3. Start your application manually using GraalVM JRE (in which `native-image-agent` is available)
with the agent attached and `test` Quarkus profile activated:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/graalvm-ce-java11-...
$ $JAVA_HOME/bin/java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=target/graal-config" -Dquarkus.profile=test -jar target/*-runner.jar
...
2021-01-31 15:58:31,675 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Profile test activated.
2021-01-31 15:58:31,676 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Installed features: [..., cdi, resteasy]
----
+
4. Run the tests in another terminal:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ mvn test # or alternatively mvn surefire:test might suffice too
...
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
----
+
5. When all the tests have passed, terminate the application running in the first terminal by pressing `CTRL+C`.
+
After that, the configuration for `native-image` should be stored in `target/graal-config`:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ tree target/graal-config
target/graal-config
â”œâ”€â”€ proxy-config.json
â”œâ”€â”€ reflect-config.json
â”œâ”€â”€ resource-config.json
â””â”€â”€ ...

==== Update 2021-02-17:

https://twitter.com/helpermethod/status/1362023754033987584[Oliver Weiler] proposed another approach:

[quote]
____
You can use the Surefire JVM,
but ignore all test-related classes by supplying an `access-filter.json` file to the `native-image-agent`.
See https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/BuildConfiguration/#access-filters[Access Filters docs].
____

=== Translate the generated config to Quarkus `BuildItems`

Once the `native-image-agent` has generated the configuration, you can study the content of the files
and consider whether and how you need to translate the individual items to Quarkus `BuildItems`.

[TIP]
====
Check https://quarkus.io/guides/writing-extensions[Quarkus for extension authors] to learn Quarkus extensions basics.
====

You typically do not need to care for all configuration items
because some of them are already covered by some core Quarkus extension,
such as `quarkus-netty`, `quarkus-jackson`, `quarkus-vertx`, etc.

For the ones that are apparently related to the library you are porting, the mapping goes like the following:

* `proxy-config.json` â†’ `https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/master/core/deployment/src/main/java/io/quarkus/deployment/builditem/nativeimage/NativeImageProxyDefinitionBuildItem.java[NativeImageProxyDefinitionBuildItem]`
* `reflect-config.json` â†’ `https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/master/core/deployment/src/main/java/io/quarkus/deployment/builditem/nativeimage/ReflectiveClassBuildItem.java[ReflectiveClassBuildItem]`
* `resource-config.json` â†’ `https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/master/core/deployment/src/main/java/io/quarkus/deployment/builditem/nativeimage/NativeImageResourceBuildItem.java[NativeImageResourceBuildItem]` or `https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/master/core/deployment/src/main/java/io/quarkus/deployment/builditem/nativeimage/NativeImageResourceBundleBuildItem.java[NativeImageResourceBundleBuildItem]`

[TIP]
====
Check https://quarkus.io/guides/all-builditems[Quarkus ``BuildItem``s reference] for more details about the available ``BuildItem``s.
====


Example: If you have something like the following in your `reflect-config.json`

[source,json]
----
[
{
  "name":"com.azure.core.util.DateTimeRfc1123",
  "allDeclaredFields":true,
  "allDeclaredMethods":true,
  "allDeclaredConstructors":true
},
{
  "name":"com.azure.storage.blob.implementation.models.BlobsGetPropertiesResponse",
  "allDeclaredConstructors":true
}
]
----

this is how you would translate it to a Quarkus `@BuildStep`:

[source,java]
----
class AzureBuildSteps {

    @BuildStep
    void reflectiveClasses(BuildProducer<ReflectiveClassBuildItem> reflectiveClasses) {

        reflectiveClasses.produce(
                new ReflectiveClassBuildItem(
                        true, // allDeclaredMethods required
                        true, // allDeclaredFields required
                        "com.azure.core.util.DateTimeRfc1123"));

        reflectiveClasses.produce(
                new ReflectiveClassBuildItem(
                        false, // allDeclaredMethods not required
                        false, // allDeclaredFields not required
                        "com.azure.storage.blob.implementation.models.BlobsGetPropertiesResponse"));

    }
}
----

=== Is that all?

Not necessarily.
As I have mentioned above, `native-image-agent` does not handle all aspects of the configuration.
Running the tests in native mode may reveal more issues that may require additional ``BuildItem``s
or even GraalVM https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/2c334c4db1ccd09b1a7ec5abdabad2e8ffe2d407/substratevm/src/com.oracle.svm.core/src/com/oracle/svm/core/annotate/TargetClass.java#L36-L70[substitutions].
That's already beyond the scope of this blog post where I primarily wanted to show
how `native-image-agent` can be leveraged when writing Quarkus extensions.
