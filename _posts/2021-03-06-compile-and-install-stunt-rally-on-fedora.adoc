= How to compile and install Stunt Rally on Fedora
:showtitle:

:page-summary: Stunt Rally is an open source racing game, one of a few available for Linux. \
It caught the attention of my son because it supports network mutiplayer mode as well as split screen multiplayer mode. \
As of writing this, there does not seem to exist an RPM package. \
There are https://snapcraft.io/stuntrally[SNAP] \
and https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.tuxfamily.StuntRally[Flatpack] packages which I have not tried. \
If you do not want those for any reason, you might find this compilation guide useful.

== Prerequisites

On Fedora 32, I had to install the following prerequisites  to be able to compile:

[source,shell]
----
sudo dnf install -y boost-devel cmake hicolor-icon-theme desktop-file-utils mygui-devel ogre-devel ois-devel enet-devel SDL2-devel libvorbis-devel libXcursor-devel bullet-devel bullet-extras-devel shiny-devel tinyxml-devel tinyxml2-devel ogre-pagedgeometry-devel dejavu-lgc-sans-fonts liberation-sans-fonts bitstream-vera-sans-fonts bitstream-vera-sans-mono-fonts openal-soft-devel cmake g++ git
----

== Clone the source repositories

Starting from here, the steps are actually the same as on the https://stuntrally.tuxfamily.org/wiki/doku.php?id=compile[Stunt Rally wiki].

[source,shell]
----
git clone git://github.com/stuntrally/stuntrally.git
cd stuntrally
SR_HOME="$(PWD)"
# get the tracks
cd data
git clone --depth=1 git://github.com/stuntrally/tracks.git
----

== Compile the game

[source,shell]
----
cd "${SR_HOME}"
mkdir build
cd build

cmake ..
make -j4        # Compile using 4 threads (change to your number of CPUs)
----

== Play the game

[source,shell]
----
./stuntrally
----

== Install (optional)

[source,shell]
----
sudo make install
----
