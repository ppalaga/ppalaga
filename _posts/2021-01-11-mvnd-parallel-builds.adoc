link:/2021/01/08/mvnd-shortcuts.html[Another] tip that will serve as a base for the future
`https://github.com/mvndaemon/mvnd[mvnd]` documentation. Today about parallel and non-parallel builds.

== Parallel by default

If you are building a multimodule source tree, whose internal dependencies allow for building some modules in parallel,
`mvnd` will, by default, build them in parallel for you. The default number of threads is one or
`Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() - 1`, whichever is greater. You can change this value using
Maven's standard parameter `-T`/`--threads`. E.g. to use five threads the command would look like this:

[source,shell]
----
$ mvnd package -T5
----

How many threads should you use? Well, it depends on two factors at least:

1. How many CPU cores are available on your machine? It typically does not bring any speedup to use more threads than
   the number of threads your machine can run at the same time. Use `lscpu` on Linux or its equivalent for your
   operating system to figure out how many CPU cores you have available.

2. Which other tasks is your machine running? If you want to work inside your IDE or browser during the build, you
   should leave one or two cores out of the set assigned to `mvnd`. That's actually the assumption behind the default
   value chosen by `mvnd`.

These are just general rules that may or may not hold for your situation. Feel free to experiment with various `-T`
values and see which setting works best for you.

[TIP]
====
`-T`/`--threads` allows for a "processor count multiplier" notation using `-T<n>C` where `<n>` is a (potentially
decimal) number to multiply the number of processors of the current machine. E.g. to use a half of the processors,
you'd use `-T0.5C`, to use twice as many threads as the number of processors, you'd use `-T2C`.
====

You can persist your preference in `~/.m2/mvnd.properties` as follows:

[source,properties]
----
mvnd.threads = 5
# or alternatively using the multiplier notation
# mvnd.threads = 0.5C
----

== `smart` builder by default

Maven has the concept of pluggable `builder` since version 3.2.1.
It is https://maven.apache.org/docs/3.2.1/release-notes#new-builder-interface-mng-5575[described] as a strategy for
scheduling and building projects. Stock Maven offers two builder implementations: `singlethreaded` and `multithreaded`.

Except for these two, at least one more can be found in the wild: the
http://takari.io/book/30-team-maven.html#takari-smart-builder[Takari Smart Builder]. ``mvnd``'s `smart` builder is
based on this one. It is actually a copy with a few minor modifications.

To characterize the Takari Smart Builder, let's cite from its http://takari.io/book/30-team-maven.html#takari-smart-builder[documentation]:

The primary difference between the standard multi-threaded scheduler in Maven and the Takari smart builder is illustrated below.

image::/images/2021/01-11-mvnd-parallel-builds/smart-builder-scheduler.png["Standard and Smart Builder Scheduling",alt="Standard and Smart Builder Scheduling"]

The standard multi-threaded scheduler is using a rather naive and simple approach of using dependency-depth information in the project. It builds everything at a given dependency-depth before continuing to the next level.

The Takari Smart Builder is using a more advanced approach of dependency-path information. Projects are aggressively built along a dependency-path in topological order as upstream dependencies have been satisfied.

`smart` builder is one of the features that make `mvnd` so much faster from the standard Maven. (The other ones are
classloader caching in the Daemon and `mvnd` command line client being a https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM] native executable.)

== Maven's serial builder via `-1`/`--serial`

You can hit various issues when building with `smart` builder, such as hidden dependencies between modules,
plugins relying on global mutable state, modules racing for system resources, etc. I am planning to dedicate my next
`mvnd` tip to those issues and I'd also like to sketch some possible solutions there. Before I do that that I can
offer only a very crude workaround if you encounter any issues with `smart` builder: fallback to the stock Maven's
single-threaded builder by passing `-1` or `--serial` on the command line:

[source,shell]
----
$ mvnd package -1
----

or you can store your choice permanently in `~/.m2/mvnd.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
mvnd.serial = true
----

That's it for today, stay tuned for the next `mvnd` tip!
