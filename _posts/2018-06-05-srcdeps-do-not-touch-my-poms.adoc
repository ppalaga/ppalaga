== Traditional dependencies

Software projects often depend on artifacts produced by other projects. Those artifacts typically contain compiled code
and are usually available in remote repositories (Maven Central, jcenter, ...) on the internet. Build tools, such as
Maven and Gradle are responsible for finding them, downloading them and adding them to the build class path of the
dependent project.


== Source dependencies

Sometimes, we find ourselves in a situation when some required binary dependency is not available in any remote
artifact repository. But we still may have access to its sources. Building manually is often sufficient, but in case we
need this regularly, a tool to automate the process becomes a necessity.

Such a tool would have to:

* Check out the sources (e.g. from a git repo)
* Build the artifacts locally
* Put them wherever the dependent project expects them (in case of Maven, this would be in the Local Maven Repository)

`https://github.com/srcdeps/srcdeps[srcdeps]` is a set of tools which provide this functionality for Maven and Gradle.


== The original "pom destructive mode"

`srcdeps` before version 3.3.0 used to work in "pom destructive mode": to be able to build some dependency from
sources, it was necessary to edit `pom.xml` of the dependent project, e.g.

[source,xml,subs=+quotes]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.my-group</groupId>
  <artifactId>my-artifact</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.3-SRC-revision-*deadbeef*</version>
</dependency><!--             â¬‘ a git commit ID, branch or tag  -->
----

I heart voices not liking this, esp. if `srcdeps` was considered for integration testing. Therefore I added the new
"pom non-desctructive mode".

== The new "pom non-desctructive mode"

In this mode, the dependency in the dependent project can stay as it is, say

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.my-group</groupId>
  <artifactId>my-artifact</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.3-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

To tell `srcdeps` that this particular dependency is a source dependency, the configuration needs to be done in
`https://github.com/srcdeps/srcdeps-core/blob/master/doc/srcdeps.yaml[srcdeps.yaml]`:

[source,yaml]
----
configModelVersion: 2.3                # srcdeps.yaml file
repositories:
  org.my-group:
    includes:
    - org.my-group
    urls:
    - git:https://github.com/someorg/my-project.git

    buildVersionPattern: .*-SNAPSHOT   # any version matching this
    buildRef: branch-master            # will be rebuilt using
                                       # master branch
----

Here, the `buildVersionPattern` and `buildRef` contain the same pieces of information that we originally stored
in the version strings of `pom.xml` files.

`srcdeps` is able to rebuild any dependency version from any tag, commitID or branch name configured in
`srcdeps.yaml`. It does not need to be a SNAPSHOT version as in the example above.


== What if other builds mess with my Local Maven Repository?

What if I rebuild `org.my-group:my-artifact:1.2.3-SNAPSHOT` at any random commit and install it to my Local
Maven Repository? The above dependent project would then see an artifact it was not supposed to be built against, right?

That's a valid concern and `srcdeps-maven` (since 3.3.1) has a build-in mechanism to avoid such situations.
When `srcdeps` sees an artifact in the Local Maven Repository, that is supposed to be built from sources, it compares
its sha1 hash against a hash it has stored itself when building it. In case of a mismatch, it simply rebuilds the
artifact from sources and remembers the new hash.


== What if I do not want `srcdeps` to replace my local SNAPSHOT?

You can run the build with `-Dsrcdeps.skip=true`. That turns the whole `srcdeps` processing off.
There is currently no way to turn `srcdeps` off per source repository. Feel free to file an
https://github.com/srcdeps/srcdeps-core/issues[issue] if you need it.
